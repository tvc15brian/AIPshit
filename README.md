# @pixels_per_inch's digital production microservices (OS X)

A collection of automator workflows to be installed as OS X Services (right-click menu tasks). I use these to speed up my digital produciton/presevation processes. 

## Installation

Paste the following code at a Terminal prompt:

```shell
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/tvc15brian/dpu-microservices/go/install)
```

The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. If you donâ€™t trust it, [download zip package](https://github.com/tvc15brian/dpu-microservices/archive/master.zip) and manually copy the workflows to `~/Library/Services/`.

## Other Notes

Please note that most workflows are using third-party scripts, the default path of them (for example `ffmpeg`) is `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`. (Installed by [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)).

## Available Workflows

- [cyclic redundancy check]
CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the CRC.

- [ffv1 (.mkv)](#coming)
Video Codec Specification

The FFV1 video codec is a simple and efficient lossless intra-frame only codec. This workflow wraps ffv1 in a Matroska wrapper.

- [framemd5](#coming)
Per-packet MD5 testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash for each audio and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.
